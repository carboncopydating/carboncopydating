We can't think for a moment if we'd say something special to you!\nWhat made you choose to be an actor? I've done roles in a myriad of video games (Ultima Online, Call of Duty), and I'm excited to be a part of such a huge franchise as Star Wars. I love Star Wars and as such I'm really into all things Star Wars related. I'm stoked that my love of Star Wars movies and music is absolutely legendary in my home state of California!\n",
