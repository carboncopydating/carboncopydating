  "introduction":"my name is Jeffrey, CEO and president of IDEO\nI'm no PoA nut, but this is my first time interacting with others and I'm not a huge fan of judgemental people telling me how to act. I'm a big fan of the Lord's Supper and Jesus Christ, drink lots of wine, and live by the Bible.\nI'm just a guy that loves animals, drink lots of good things and have fun. I'm a dad, a husband, a lover of nature and life, and a person that is able-bodied, lazy, and speaks in little over an accent.\n",
