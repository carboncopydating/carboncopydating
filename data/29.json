  "introduction":"my name is Kate, and I'm freeborn. I've never had any fun in my entire life. My friends say I'm weird, because I'm a bit geeky. But I'm not really a big fan of the word geek, because it means something different to me than anything. I wouldn't do that. I would just like to live my life my personal way. \nI enjoy sports, fishing, hiking, cooking, traveling, film, all things that are very social. I have a son named Jake, and I'm a very good math teacher. I go to school for my days off, and my friends say I'm weird because I like science. But I have never had any fun in my entire life. My friends would also like to know what you think about this. \n\n"
