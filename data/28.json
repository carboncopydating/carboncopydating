  "introduction":"my name is Sarah and I believe in God. I love animals, hiking & traveling. I am a singer-songwriter and I love to clown. I am a hard working woman. I have a passion for music, travel, business, and people. Please message me for more information.\n\nI live in the Boston/hamilton area. My favorite place to be is anytime is great spend the morning at my room by the firebox reading and talking alone and just have a good time. Oh and I also love when my friends have dinner with me and my friends room opens and I have to hide in the living room until my friends get home from the meal assuming I'm still thinking about my dinner...just kidding.\n\nI love casuals and casual night swimming. I would love to meet other people's friends in bars and clubs and enjoy them while we have a great time. I'd also like to know how to make homemade cocktails, and if I have the means so that I can share some quality homemade cocktail recipes with you guys. Please message me if you would like me to try and find someone else to share my everyday life with.\n",
