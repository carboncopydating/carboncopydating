  "introduction":"Hi, I'm a writer and a businessman. I believe in God's will and believe this because I reject both. I also know that God created me and me as a small child to serve in the military. I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts and have worked in construction, hotels, restaurants, and other endeavors. I had a very good job as a lawyer before I even graduated high school.
