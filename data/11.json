  "introduction":"my name is Papa S, I had real bad depression, I took my own life of course in 2009 but now I'm an incredibly funny guy and have evergreen tattoos.\nI learned how to ride a bike by taking a camp high and had a 3 year old in October of 2014. In 10 months my bike has taken a big step back and I need your help to back this mission. I am waiting patiently to be able to walk again so if you'd like to take a moment to give back please do so.\n"
