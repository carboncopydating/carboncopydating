  "introduction":"my name is Parra, I just finished my Masters in Public Administration at the University of Rochester, will always love birdsong and will always cherish life's small moments.\n\nI love dogs, hiking, fishing, office work, and traveling.\n\nI'm a fan of everything dogs and hiking do. I dabble at craft beer, and am a lifelong dog lover. I'm married, two kids, and am still a responsible dog owner.\n\nI enjoy lots of nature walks, picnics, bike rides, movie nights, picnics at the beach, picnics on the way home from work, weddings, birthday parties, and a few other things. I love to cuddle, take care of business, and make you happy. I've been rated by many as a \"Dinner Outdoors Star\" by critics, and I think that's pretty awesome.\n",
